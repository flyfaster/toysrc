	C.7.6.3.1.3 Planar Configuration
Planar Configuration (0028,0006) indicates whether the color pixel data are sent color-by-plane
or color-by-pixel. This Attribute shall be present if Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value
greater than 1. It shall not be present otherwise.
Enumerated Values:
0 = The sample values for the first pixel are followed by the sample values for the second
pixel, etc. For RGB images, this means the order of the pixel values sent shall be R1,
G1, B1, R2, G2, B2, ..., etc. 
1 = Each color plane shall be sent contiguously. For
RGB images, this means the order of the pixel values sent is R1, R2, R3, ..., G1, G2,
G3, ..., B1, B2, B3, etc.
Note: Planar Configuration (0028,0006) is not meaningful when a compression transfer syntax is used
that involves reorganization of sample components in the compressed bit stream. In such cases,
since the Attribute is required to be sent, then an appropriate value to use may be specified in
the description of the Transfer Syntax in PS 3.5, though in all likelihood the value of the Attribute
will be ignored by the receiving implementation.
