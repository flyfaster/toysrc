The original project was created by Itay Szekely. The following is original
statement of the project.

Copy Location Shell Extension


This shell extension adds the ability to copy file and
folder names from the Windows Explorer window to the
clipboard.
Simply select the file(s) whose name you want to copy,
right-click and select "Copy File Path" or "Copy File Name"
from the context menu. Then paste to any editor.
Copy File Path - copies the entire path to the file.
Copy File Name - copies only the file name without the folder.


Setup

1. Unzip CopyLocation.zip to the folder where you want to
   install the utility (e.g., C:\Winnt).
2. Go to the installation folder and double-click on
   Install.bat.
3. If you with, you can delete Install.bat.

Install.bat registers CopyLocation.dll in the system.

Alternatively you can:
1. Copy CopyLocation.dll to the installation folder (e.g.,
   C:\Winnt).
2. From the Start menu select Run...
3. Type "regsvr32.exe C:\Winnt\CopyLocation.dll" and press
   OK (specify the exact installation folder)

To uninstall the shell extension:
1. From the Start menu select Run...
2. Type "regsvr32.exe /u C:\Winnt\CopyLocation.dll" and
   press OK (specify the exact installation folder)
3. Delete CopyLocation.dll from the installation folder.
